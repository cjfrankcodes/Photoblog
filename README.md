# Photoblog
Photo blog made using HTML and CSS

This project was created using HTML and CSS skills learned in the past 2 weeks during my Udemy Web Development Bootcamp. This webpage is a mock up photo blog made to demonstrate my new knowledge of classes, ids, transitions, and some baseline flexbox. I also gave the page a navbar with dummy links to different sections. I also gave the links small transitions to try and give the page a little style. I tried to make the webpage as responsive as possible. There is much more to learn but I am proud of the work I've put in and the skills I have learned.
